- Fix the badblock management in the Read method of SmartNANDReader (and then test it, once done it'll replace NANDReader)
- Add JTAG SMC Patch engine (dynamic one if possible)
- Add more tests to the Test GUI
- Add missing features (dunno what more to add right now, but... there's probably something...)
- Fix bugs (if you can find any?)
